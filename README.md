# Double Time: Tracking FEMA's Processing Speed Bump

This is a visualization about what happens when FEMA gets less money and fewer people to do the same amount of work. Spoiler: processing times for disaster assistance literally doubled in late 2025.

## What's going on

In 2025, FEMA went through some rough changes. The staff got cut by a third and the budget got slashed by $645 million. Then in October, another $11 billion in disaster payments got canceled. The result? Disaster victims waiting months longer for help.

The chart tracks all of this from 2022 through the end of 2025, showing how the processing times climbed when the budget cuts happened. It's not complicated math—fewer people = longer wait times, especially when you're dealing with the same number of disaster applications.

## How to use it

Just open the page in your browser and hover over the dots to see specific disasters. The annotations on the chart show when the big policy changes happened.

## The data

This uses FEMA's official disaster declaration data. It's pretty straightforward—how long did it actually take to process each disaster declaration?
