# Double Time: Tracking FEMA's Processing Speed Bump

This is a visualization about what happens when FEMA gets less money and fewer people to do the same amount of work. Spoiler: processing times for disaster assistance doubled in late 2025.

## What's going on

In 2025, FEMA went through a lot of changes. The staff got cut by a third and the budget got slashed by $645 million. Then in October, another $11 billion in disaster payments got canceled. The result? Disaster victims waiting months longer for help.

The chart tracks all of this from 2022 through the end of 2025, showing how the processing times climbed when the budget cuts happened. 

## The data

This uses FEMA's official disaster declaration data. I calculated the difference between the day the declaration request was filed and the day it was declared in order to get the processing time. I also calculated the average processing time for each quarter and each quarters standard deviation.
